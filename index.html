                <h2>Preparation method</h2>
                <p>In a blender, beat the water, instant coffee, eggs, oil, sugar and chocolate powder until smooth. Transfer to a bowl, add the flour and yeast and mix with a spoon. Pour into cupcake molds lined with paper liners and place in a large pan, one next to the other. Bake in a preheated medium oven for 25 minutes or until baked and golden. Remove and let cool. <br><br> 
                    For the filling, heat all the ingredients over medium heat, stirring well until it thickens. Turn it off, let it cool and place it inside a piping bag with a pearl nozzle. Book. Place the whipped cream inside a piping bag fitted with a piping tip and set aside. <br><br>
                    To assemble, make a hole in the center of the cupcakes and fill with the reserved coffee brigadeiro. Decorate the surfaces of the cupcakes with the reserved whipped cream, making circles. Decorate with coffee beans and refrigerate until ready to serve.
